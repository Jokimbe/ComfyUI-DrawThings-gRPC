# ComfyUI-DrawThings-gRPC

Connect to any Draw Things [gRPCServerCLI](https://github.com/drawthingsai/draw-things-community/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#self-host-grpcservercli-from-packaged-binaries) and let ComfyUI generate and provide DT with images for ControlNet without needing to set them in DT itself.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you are getting an error after updating, you may have to right click the sampler node and select "Fix node (recreate)"
> - TLS is now enabled by default - you no longer need to disable the setting in Draw Things
> - Previews might look wrong for some models, however this does not have any influence over the final image.

## Draw Things gRPC server

    --no-response-compression
    --model-browser

## TODO

- Add all possible options
- Create example workflows
- Automatically check for incompatible settings/models
